## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) for smart contract development
- A Stacks wallet (Hiro Wallet recommended)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone and Setup**
   ```bash
   mkdir workshield-stacks
   cd workshield-stacks
   
   # Initialize Clarinet project
   clarinet new . --name workshield
   
   # Create frontend
   mkdir frontend
   cd frontend
   npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --use-npm
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # In frontend directory
   npm install @stacks/connect @stacks/network @stacks/transactions @stacks/auth
   npm install @tanstack/react-query framer-motion zustand lucide-react
   ```

3. **Deploy Contracts (Testnet)**
   ```bash
   # From root directory
   clarinet check
   clarinet deployments apply testnet
   ```

4. **Configure Frontend**
   ```bash
   # Create .env.local in frontend directory
   echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_ESCROW_CONTRACT=YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS" > .env.local
   echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=testnet" >> .env.local
   ```

5. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
